# Determining the profitability of NYC zipcodes
The objective of this notebook is to present an analysis of publicly available data from Zillow and Airbnb to determine which zip codes in New York City (NYC) are most profitable and hence best to invest in. The analysis is roughly structured to follow the CRISP DM framework, an open standard process for data mining. 

The source code, outputs, insights and conclusions are combined and laid out in this notebook. All assumptions taken during the course of this analysis are also documented here and the analysis is concluded by highlighting some steps that can be taken to drive this analysis further and to make even more accurate decisions.
